After the installation and setup process is complete, we can begin using the software for underwater localization tasks. This typically involves:

1. Running localization algorithms on the submarine's onboard systems to estimate its position and orientation.
2. Integrating localization data with other subsystems of the submarine for navigation, mapping, and mission execution.
3. Testing and validating localization software in simulated environments and real-world underwater trials to ensure accuracy and reliability.

## Problems and Fixes
During the development and implementation of localization solutions, we may encounter various issues and challenges and they will be posted here.

## Future Seniors
We have setup the main repo for localization and have seperate codes that are a good start to progress forward with localization
